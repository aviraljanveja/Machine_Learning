// Here, the initialization and iteration expressions have been moved out of the for. 
// While this is of no value in this simple example?indeed, it would be
// considered quite poor style ? there can be times when this type of approach makes sense.
// For example, if the initial condition is set through a complex expression elsewhere in the
// program or if the loop control variable changes in a non-sequential manner determined by
// actions that occur within the body of the loop, then it may be appropriate to leave these parts of
// the for empty.
